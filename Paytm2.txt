We need time series databases, time scale db is a famous one, that lets you store time series data.
The reason you need a time series database is whenever you have a chart like share market graph, you allow
the user to come to your website and select 1 month, 1 week, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year you have some time lines to support
toh its a good idea to catch there 1 month performance, there 3 months performance, there 6 months performance in a database which is why its a good idea 
to use time series database 

Seeding a database means ki when the users starts the application, there database is completely empty, 
there are a bunch of tables, but there is no data in the users table, there is no data in the balances table
so its a good idea to seed some data in there, to put some dummy data in there, so that whenever the users starts the application
they are able to go to the website, visit it and signup/signin, do a bunch of things
To do it in prisma create a prisma/seed.ts file 
so common file that you create to seed data
upsert means either insert or if the entry already exists for this specific number, then update that entry because we might run it again and again 
and we will face errors if you just do a create over here, because first time it is created, second time it will give you a conflict, the user with this number already exists 
which is why prisma.user.upsert, upsert means create or update, if it is already there then update, if it is not there then insert 

We dont store decimals in databases, in a financial application which is why i havent stored 20 because if the user has 20.2 rupees now i can just store 2020 vs storing 20.20 is a big no no in a financial application
due to precision issues, it might happen that whenever you get this entry you might get 20.199999 like this and then you know some user is missing some money which is not great 

OnRamp means you are ramping money from a bank account to your wallet, this is what called onramping 
For an application like this you want to allow the user to put in an amount select up netbanking, card like these and whenever they select it click on add money
they should be taken to axisbank.com, they should finish there transactions there and axisbank should tell us ke bhai they have submitted 200 rs pls credit there money to there account

Action is just another way for you to define a function that can be called either on a client or a server, for all partical purposes assume ki it is similar to creating an http endpoint 
bcz in the end it does work via http, when creating a server action use "use server" at the top so that the frontend knows ki the OnRapTransaction exists on the server, this needs to be called on the server, if we dont add use server
this will called on button click, it will not able to connect to the database we probably see an error, make sure you have "use server" on every action you create
server action is a function that we use both on frontend and backend as well.

Starting bankwebhook service, which is listening to requests from banks, whenever the user goes to a bank and does the successful transaction, the bank server will hit the bankwebhook server
