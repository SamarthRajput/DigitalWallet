we needs 2 frontends
1. for the user 
2. for the merchant

User can withdraw money, deposit money, see there recent transactions and transfer money to there friends
Merchant can see how much money is coming into there shop every month, or every day and transactions

These external services are not very reliable, HDFC server you can't assume to be very reliable. we cant just assume sending money to hdfc bank will be easy by
just calling an api https://api.hdfcbank.com/transfer/harkirat/1000, banks have very high latency, you have to track this transfer very heavily, has it reached the bank or not
and the same happens in the crypto exchange  
Thats why a paytm like application and a cryptoexchange like binance are similar because the way you architect the system is assuming people are going to send money, spend money, withdraw money from an 
external highly unreliable service thats why are the architecture fairly similar 

We want our primary application that will scale up and down, will have a lot of traffic to be different, deployed differently 
We want our webhook backend or bank api service that is talking directly to the banks to be different, it will have multiple end points , 1 for hdfc bank that the hdfc bank api will hit and similarly if there is a axis bank, it will hit its api so on and so forth.

There will be an application logic on the endpoint in the webhook backend that will add a purchase to the database, thats why we need a webhook server 
we need our webhook server be always up at all times that why we deploy it separately 

We will be sending money here to hdfc bank or hitting an api Whenever the user request for the withdraw, there is the withdraw option, if they click on the withdraw option 
they have the option of sending there wallet balance back to hdfc or whatever bank they want, when that happens we need to hit HDFC bank server 

If a user comes to your website and asks to withdraw money then you can hit the hdfc bank server, if it responds back it 10s ki bhai transfer is done we can tell the end user transfer is done
we can debit the amount from there account/our website wallet or if we dont want to give them a back a bad experience, if they ask for some transfer and you are hitting hdfc bank and hdfc bank is down and we want to keep retrying it then we need another service
called withdraw service whos job is simple ki bhai if someone is asked for the withdrawal, then is withdrawal request will sit in a queue,
We need to make sure ke if people are asking for withdrawals and very quickly clicking the withdraw button, you process them sequentially, you hit the bank server,if it says transfer is done you come back, you subtract there wallet balance
then you pick the next item for that user, never parallely request or parallely process 2 withdrawal request for the same user.


If you want to build zerodha or a normal broker as well then also we need on ramping, on ramping is a commonly used term/thing that we need if you want to build any financial application
where you want to accept money from a bank, this becomes slighly easier if you are using something called razorpay or stripe they made all of this very easy 

Whenever you go to zerodha, and you select i pay rs 2000 via netbanking, what happens is zerodha first tells hfdc bank my userId: 1 wanting to spend amount: 2000, you tell hdfc i am going send someone pls charge them 2000rs and let me know when you charged them 
so that i can do +2000 here on there wallet, also pls send that 2000rs to my zerodha bank account, it isnt neccessary, the accumulating bank account of zerodha is in hdfc it could be in kotak
So the first thing that zerodha does when you select hdfc bank, is tells hdfc bank ki bhai i want to initiate a transaction for this user of my database (userId : 1 of my database) for this amount and hdfc says okay here is a token which you should send the user to when you are
sending them to netbanking.hdfcbank.com
The second thing hdfc bank does is it tells the zerodha backend server, ki bhai payment was done on our side, we have taken 2000 rs from user with id 1 and we will send it to you eventually pls do +200
this final thing that you call over here is whats called a webhook, ki bhai zerodha has a webhook or an api endpoint (internal.zerodha.com/hdfc) that hdfc can send a request to tell zerodha ki bro userid:1 has paid rs2000 pls add them to your balance
and thats how financial application talks to the bank.

What does not happen is, what you might think happens but doesnot happen is, ki you know user is on netbanking page and when they succeed with the netbanking payment, they dont get redirect to first the make my trip frontend and then the frontend doesnt tell the backend ki han the payment has been done 
when the user is on the netbanking page, the hdfc server directly tells the backend ki han payment has been done, hdfc server talks to the backend, makemytrip frontend doesnt talk to this backend bcz if makemytrip frontend talk to the backend, 
that means the user can always send this request a modified request ki bhai i paid rs 1 lakh or something like that to the server and the backend will be like okay.

Whenever you are writing a webhook since it exposed over the internet, who ever is calling this webhook you need to share a password with them so that you are able to validate ki the request is actually coming from them.
then you can also do a ip based blocking

the merchant-application that people like swiggy will use, or your dukaan dar or shopkeeper will use Whenever they are accepting payments via paytm
the user-application which is the core paytm application that end user use 

export const GET = handler;
export const POST = handler;
these both is same as 
export { handler as GET, handler as POST }

bcrypt.hash lets you convert the password into a hash so that to prevent you putting plane text passwords, you hash them 
bcrypt.hash will always give you the new hash, its not neccessary ki if you hash 123456 the output will be same, could be different outputs 
even the hashes are different bcrypt.compare returned a true when we compare the database hashed password and user input hashed password, it was able to compare
ki han the original thing from which these 2 were created is the same 

we want the landing page, the first page that the users sees, is this transfer page, so we need to support a netbanking option here, allow the user to select hdfc bank click on submit, send the user to a dummy hdfc bank page
and assume that the payment succeeds create the webhook server 

We will create bank webhook handler which will hit our dummy bank server as we are not connecting to the hdfc bank right now 
As a paytm developer we only have to build the webhook server that hdfc bank will hit and whenever the user is on your website we need to show them a button ki bhai select your bank
when they click on submit we need to redirect them to nextbanking.hdfc.com another frontend, you dont have to write all of the dummy bank logic 

Create a new folder in apps called bank-webhook, since our webhook server is just going to be an express server we just need to install express 
Whenever the person comes to the website and clicks on the button you should make a database entry ki bhai onRampTransaction has been started with the status pending and then whenever
the webhook gets hit you should update this status to either success or failure 

transactions was different when we are doing paytm before, that was for different type of transaction, that was for when you are increasing the balance of one person 
and decreasing the balance for other user this is something else, this ki you want balance update and onramp transaction happens together, if either one of fails then you tell paytm 
ke bro i have not increase the balance, i have not added a transaction success pls refund the money 

If you ever think of doing a startup and building something like razorpay, even the folks at razorpay build there complete stack before raising funds by creating a dummy bank server and showed the investors
ki dekho we have a dummy bank server through which every things work. If you want banking apis you need to have 25cr in a bank account 

the balances table is the very simple table that you should just have initially added, we added this in original paytm project as well which will store 
ki bhai this userId has this much amount in there current wallet, relationship ki bhai this specific balance is for this specific user is what the schema of the balances table 
The other thing we should do is, ki whenever user signups we should put an entry in the balances table with a balance = 0, so you know user has only one entry in the balances table 
as we can see the userId is unique, toh every user should have an entry over here, so whenever the users signups we should put a balances entry for that user 

model OnRampTransaction, the entry is inserted when you are on the front page and click on the button called i want to paym via netbanking, this is updated to success or failure 
whenever hdfc bank hits your express server
